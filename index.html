        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a website.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Short for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how website content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Whereas HTML handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the aesthetics & visual layout.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
