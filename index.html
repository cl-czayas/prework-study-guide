        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a website.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Short for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how website content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Whereas HTML handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the aesthetics & visual layout.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>When the computer encounters an 'if' statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
          <li>Sometimes we want to provide more conditions than just 'if'. In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition by using 'else if'.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li>Each item in an array is assigned an index according to the order in which it is stored in the array.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop contains the following three important statements:
            <ol>
              <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0).</li>
              <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running.</li>
              <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1.</li>
            </ol>
